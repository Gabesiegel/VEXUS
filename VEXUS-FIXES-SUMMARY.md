# VEXUS System Fixes Summary

## Issue Identified

The VEXUS system was experiencing issues with the on-demand endpoint service. The server was trying to use the on-demand endpoint service first, but it was getting 404 errors. If that failed, it would try to make direct Vertex AI calls, which were also failing with INVALID_ARGUMENT errors.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **On-Demand Service URL Issue**:
   - The environment variable in the Cloud Run configuration was set to:
     ```
     ON_DEMAND_ENDPOINT_SERVICE=https://endpoints-on-demand-plucky-weaver-450819-k7.us-central1.run.app
     ```
   - The correct URL is:
     ```
     https://endpoints-on-demand-456295042668.us-central1.run.app
     ```
   - This was confirmed by checking the endpoints-on-demand/cloudbuild.yaml file and the actual deployed service.

2. **Direct Vertex AI Calls Issue**:
   - The direct Vertex AI calls were failing with INVALID_ARGUMENT errors.
   - This was happening because of differences in how the Node.js SDK and Python SDK format the requests to Vertex AI.
   - The Node.js SDK requires specific classes from the protos module to format the request properly.

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Fixed On-Demand Service URL**:
   - Updated the environment variable in the Cloud Run configuration to use the correct URL:
     ```
     ON_DEMAND_ENDPOINT_SERVICE=https://endpoints-on-demand-456295042668.us-central1.run.app
     ```

2. **Enhanced Server.js**:
   - Updated the server.js file to prioritize the on-demand service and add more logging.
   - Added more detailed logging to the makeApiCallWithRetry function to help diagnose any future issues.
   - Ensured the default URL in the code matches the correct URL.

3. **Fixed Direct Vertex AI Calls**:
   - Created a test script (test-vertex-proper-format.js) that uses the proper format from the Vertex AI documentation.
   - Updated the server.js file to use the proper format for direct Vertex AI calls as a backup option.
   - This involved using specific classes from the protos module to format the request properly:
     ```javascript
     const {instance, params, prediction} = protos.google.cloud.aiplatform.v1.schema.predict;
     
     // Create parameters object using the proper format
     const parametersObj = new params.ImageClassificationPredictionParams({
         confidenceThreshold: 0.0,
         maxPredictions: 5,
     });
     const parameters = parametersObj.toValue();
     
     // Create instance object with the image
     const instanceObj = new instance.ImageClassificationPredictionInstance({
         content: base64Image,
     });
     const instanceValue = instanceObj.toValue();
     ```

## Verification

We ran tests to verify the fixes:

1. **On-Demand Service Test**:
   - The on-demand service is now working correctly for all vein types (hepatic, portal, renal).
   - It returns proper predictions with confidence scores.

2. **Direct Vertex AI Calls**:
   - The direct Vertex AI calls now work correctly with the proper format.
   - This provides a robust backup option in case the on-demand service is unavailable.

## Recommendations for Future

1. **Prioritize the On-Demand Service**:
   - The on-demand service is working correctly and should be used as the primary method for making predictions.
   - It handles the Vertex AI calls correctly using the Python SDK.

2. **Use Direct Calls as Backup**:
   - The direct Vertex AI calls now work correctly with the proper format.
   - This provides a robust backup option in case the on-demand service is unavailable.

3. **Monitor Logs**:
   - The enhanced logging will help diagnose any future issues.
   - Regularly check the logs to ensure the on-demand service is working correctly.
