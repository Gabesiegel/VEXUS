# VExUS System Optimizations

This document provides details on the optimizations implemented to improve the VExUS prediction system.

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Image Preprocessing and Optimization

**File: `image-optimizer.js`**

We've implemented image preprocessing to reduce payload sizes:

- Automatically resizes large images (configurable max width)
- Applies quality compression while maintaining image clarity
- Supports multiple formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
- Gracefully falls back to original image if optimization fails
- Reports compression statistics

**Benefits:**
- Reduces base64 payload size by 50-80% for large images
- Decreases bandwidth costs and improves response times
- Minimizes likelihood of timeouts or quota issues

### 2. Endpoint Pooling

**File: `endpoints-on-demand/main.py`**

Implemented a sophisticated endpoint pooling system:

- Reuses existing endpoints instead of creating new ones for every request
- Manages endpoint lifecycle with usage tracking
- Intelligently selects endpoints based on recency
- Enforces maximum endpoints per model type
- Properly releases endpoints back to the pool after use

**Benefits:**
- Significantly reduces endpoint creation/deletion operations
- Lowers quota usage and costs
- Improves average response time by reducing cold starts
- More efficient resource utilization

### 3. Adaptive Timeouts

**File: `endpoints-on-demand/main.py`**

Implemented adaptive timeout logic that:

- Tracks usage patterns over a 24-hour window
- Adjusts endpoint timeout based on frequency of use
- Keeps frequently used endpoints alive longer
- Cleans up rarely used endpoints more quickly

**Benefits:**
- Balances resource costs with performance
- Optimizes for frequently used predictions
- Prevents resource waste for rarely used endpoints

### 4. Preemptive Quota Management

**File: `endpoints-on-demand/main.py`**

Added preemptive quota management to:

- Monitor endpoint count against configurable thresholds
- Proactively clean up old endpoints before reaching limits
- Provide better error messages with solution steps
- Include quota-check endpoint for system monitoring

**Benefits:**
- Prevents quota exceeded errors
- Automatically maintains system health
- Provides actionable error messages when limits are reached

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling and Logging

**Both client and server code**

Improved error handling throughout:

- Detailed logging of optimization metrics
- Better error categorization and reporting
- Graceful fallbacks for failure scenarios
- Clear debugging suggestions

### 6. Endpoint Cleanup Utility

**File: `cleanup-endpoints.js`**

Created an interactive utility script to:

- List all current endpoints
- Delete specific or all endpoints
- Provide interactive management of resources

## Usage Instructions

### Image Optimization

```javascript
import { optimizeImageFile, getOptimizedBase64 } from './image-optimizer.js';

// Optimize an image file
const optimizedImage = await optimizeImageFile('path/to/image.jpg', {
    maxWidth: 1024,  // Resize to max 1024px width
    quality: 85      // Good quality with reasonable compression
});

console.log(`Compressed from ${optimizedImage.originalSize} to ${optimizedImage.optimizedSize} bytes`);
console.log(`Compression ratio: ${optimizedImage.compressionRatio}x`);

// Or directly get optimized base64
const base64Result = await getOptimizedBase64('path/to/image.jpg');
console.log(`Base64 size: ${base64Result.sizeInMB} MB`);
```

### Endpoint Management

The on-demand service now efficiently manages endpoints automatically, but you can also:

```bash
# Check quota and endpoint status
curl https://endpoints-on-demand-456295042668.us-central1.run.app/quota-check

# Clean up all unused endpoints
curl -X POST https://endpoints-on-demand-456295042668.us-central1.run.app/cleanup

# Or use the interactive cleanup utility
node cleanup-endpoints.js
```

## Performance Impact

These optimizations should result in:

1. **Lower costs**: Through better resource management and smaller payloads
2. **Improved reliability**: By preventing quota issues
3. **Better response times**: Through endpoint reuse and image optimization
4. **More efficient operation**: Through adaptive timeouts and endpoint pooling

## Monitoring Recommendations

To ensure optimal performance:

1. Monitor the `/quota-check` endpoint regularly
2. Track usage patterns via the `/health` endpoint
3. Set up alerts for quota near-limit situations
4. Periodically run the cleanup utility during low-usage periods
